This is not a mechanism for extensive analysis of microarray data. It is main purpose is to facilitated microarray data manipulation in the context of Gudmap database in terms of providing a more meaningful visualization of microarray data and integration mechanisms with other Gudmap data (e.g. In-Situ). The prototype is in an initial stage of development and can be improved as required. </p>      <p>The analysis and visualisation includes three steps:</p>      <ol>        <li> data selection</li>        <li>filtering</li>        <li>visualisation. </li>      </ol>            <p>Currently only a set of samples that associated with Series can be selected. </p>      <p><a name="Geo"></a>The GEO series id is used to access samples. This can be improved to include samples from different series, samples associated with biologicalvariable, etc. </p>      <p>There are three filtering mechanisms implemented in this prototype, however more appropriate filtering mechanisms should be discussed and agreed in the consortium. </p>      <p>The analysis mechanism provided by this prototype is hierarchical clustering based on the Cluster library from Eisen's lab. </p>      <p>The results of clustering is then visualised using an applet on a separate window. The applet uses a third party open source program called Java TreeView. </p>      <p>We have modified Java Tree View to be able to integrate it with Gudmap database interface. In Java TreeView it is possible to select a list of genes and export it as file. One idea that we are currently working on it to use the selected gene list to query Gudmap database and return associated ISH data. </p>      <h1><a name="Guide"></a>Users Guide</h1>      <p>The analysis and visualisation is done in three steps. </p>      <p><strong>First step selecting the samples</strong>.&nbsp; Samples are selected by entering a Series Id, which is an id from the Gudmap database (e.g. 2, 3 ...). <a href="#Geo">(see above)</a> </p>      <p>After entering a Series Id and clicking Get Samples, all the samples associated with that Series are retrieved from the database. If retrieval is successful then some statistics about the set of samples is displayed on the screen. Note that because of the large amount of data being retrieved this step might take few seconds to complete. </p>      <p><strong>The second step</strong> is filtering genes to reduce the number of genes so that analysis and visualisation can be performed interactively. </p>      <p>Three different filtering methods are provided. Filter participation can be set by clicking in a check box and the number of genes that passed each filter is displayed on the screen. There are other parameters related to each filter that can be adjusted by the users. Note that genes that are filtered out by each individual filter might be overlapped therefore the total number of genes that passed all the filters is also displayed.</p>      <p><strong>The last step</strong> is clustering and visualisation. </p>      <p>There are two parameters for hierarchical clustering: Clustering method and Distance Measure. </p>      <p>When clustering genes, signal values corresponding to one gene in all samples are considered as a whole (a signal value vector). </p>      <ul>        <li>Distance measure determines the method that will be used to measure similarity between two signal vectors. </li>        <li>Clustering method determines how the distance between nodes is calculated in terms of their members. </li>      </ul>      <p>After choosing clustering parameters the Cluster button should be clicked to perform the clustering and visualisation. </p>      <p>Clustering a large number of genes requires significant computing resources and might take a long processing time. Since this is a prototype we limit the number of genes to 1000. If total number of genes after filtering is more than 1000 a warning message appears to indicate that only the first 1000 genes will be clustered and visualised. </p>      <p>Clustering takes a few seconds to complete and after that an applet window appears to show the result.</p>      <h1><a name="Notes"></a>Notes for viewing the cluster analysis result</h1>      <p>After clicking the Cluster button, the applet may take up to a minute to display.</p>			<p>Applet:</p>      <ul>				<li>Mac Firefox, have to mouseover the applet for any text to appear initially.</li>				<li>Mac Firefox: no menus for applet.</li>				<li>Mac Safari: menus are part of the browser menu</li>				<li>When a gene symbol is selected from the list it displays the MGI page in a pop up window. 				    Also when querying Gudmap ISH for selected genes the results is displayed in a pop up window. 				    If the browser in use has pop ups blocked, the new window will not open.            In Mac Firefox a warning appears on the main browser window and a button can be clicked to allow the popup to be displayed            In Internet Explorer CTL+click the gene symbol or the query botton to allow the popup to be displayed.				</li>      </ul>      <ul></ul>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p></td>  </tr></table><p class ="plaintextbold">&nbsp;</p><jsp:include page="/includes/footer.jsp" />
