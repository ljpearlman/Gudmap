The nephric duct is subdivided along its anterior-posterior length, into the pronephric portion, mesonephric portion (part of the mesonephros) (located in mesonephros, anterior), metanephric portion (adjacent to the metanephros) and common nephric duct (posterior portion below the metanephros). These regions are stage-dependant, with the pronephric portion present at TS14 in the pronephros, the mesonpehric portion from TS15 in the mesonephros and posterior to these, the metanephric portion from TS17. The regions are part of either the urinary or reproductive system. After the urogenital sinus extends from the cloaca, the nephric duct connects to the dorsal side of the caudal urogenital sinus at the urogenital sinus ridge. The ducts are marked by Cdh1 and Hoxb7. As the ontology becomes gender-specific, the nephric duct becomes the nephric duct of male/female (from TS20).",

"DEF_DEFINITION" : "genital tubercle of male (GT) (syn: penis anlage): a medial swelling seen at the level of the hind limb buds, adjacent to the cloaca and posterior/caudal to the urogenital sinus (UGS). The genital tubercle is separated into male and female, therefore you must know the sex of the embryo. At TS20, the genital tubercle of male is comprised of genital tubercle mesenchyme of male, urethral plate epithelium of male, skin of genital tubercle of male, the urogenital membrane of male, and developing vasculature of male genital tubercle. The urethral plate epithelium and skin together, where they are in direct contact, are known as the urogenital membrane. After TS20, the genital tubercle becomes further subdivided. At TS21 the genital tubercle of male is subdivided into distal genital tubercle of male (TS21-TS22) (syn: early glans of male), proximal genital tubercle of male (TS21-TS22) and preputial swelling of male. Also contains phallic urethra of male and nerve of male genital tubercle (from TS22). From TS23, it is subdivided into glans of male genital tubercle (located distally) and preputial swelling of male (located proximally and becoming prepuce of male at TS24). Will become the penis at TS25.",

The genital tubercle is separated into male and female, therefore you must know the sex of the embryo. At TS20, the genital tubercle of male is comprised of genital tubercle mesenchyme of male, urethral plate epithelium of male, skin of genital tubercle of male, the urogenital membrane of male, and developing vasculature of male genital tubercle. The urethral plate epithelium and skin together, where they are in direct contact, are known as the urogenital membrane. After TS20, the genital tubercle becomes further subdivided. At TS21 the genital tubercle of male is subdivided into distal genital tubercle of male (TS21-TS22) (syn: early glans of male), proximal genital tubercle of male (TS21-TS22) and preputial swelling of male. Also contains phallic urethra of male and nerve of male genital tubercle (from TS22). From TS23, it is subdivided into glans of male genital tubercle (located distally) and preputial swelling of male (located proximally and becoming prepuce of male at TS24). Will become the penis at TS25.",
